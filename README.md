# SML-Tokenizer-and-Parser
Assignment for Course CSL-226. Uses DFA for tokenising and Recursive Descent Parser(RDP) for code generation. \
The following file needs three files as arguments i.e one code file and two empty files 

* The first empty file after successful Code Generation has Tokens generated
* The second empty file will be the IR CODE generated for the WHILE Language code inputed

# Instructions
Open cmd prompt or terminal, navigate to the directory
cd SML-Tokenizer-and-Parser
```
cd SML-Tokenizer-and-Parser/
```
Generate new empty files within directory
```
touch output1.txt
touch output1.txt
```
COMMAND
```
sml Tokenizer_parser.sml Sample Codes/sample1.txt output1.txt output2.txt
```

Here the sample1.txt has your WHILE Sample code, output1.txt and output2.txt are the empty files you need to create in the same directory
